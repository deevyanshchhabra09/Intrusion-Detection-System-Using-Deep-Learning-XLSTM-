# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Deep-Learning-XLSTM-
This project is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed as part of a B.Tech final year project. The IDS is designed to identify and classify network intrusions using Deep Learning techniques, specifically leveraging XLSTM (Extended Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
